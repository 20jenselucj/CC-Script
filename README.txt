Thanks for downloading CC Script!


---------------INSTALLATION HELP:---------------

This script has a couple of dependencies, mainly Python 2.7 which can be downloaded here:
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

The other modules that are needed are linked below followed by their name:

(PyHook), used to detect mouse and keyboard events outside of the running script:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/	

(Pywin32, for controlling mouse-clicks)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20218/pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe/download

Both of those are simple to install, the download as .exe's so just click and run. Just make sure you select the directory in which you installed Python,
this typically "C:/Python27".


---------------HOW TO:---------------

After installing the above packages, simply click the CC.py script wherever you downloaded it. The
cookie clicker website will appear, click the cookie once, and the script will begin.

To stop clicking just press escape on your keyboard.

This can be run indefinitely, however you lose control of your mouse when it is running, so I suggest running it while take a schnooze.
